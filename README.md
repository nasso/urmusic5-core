# urmusic5-dev
The indev repo for the upcoming next major release of urmusic.

This version isn't made for use, and since no LICENSE has been decided yet,
I recommend you do not clone/edit this repo and then redistribute it.

It's made in Java, I use OpenGL (with JOGL) to render the video.
Currently nothing Audio related has been done but it definitely will come,
since that's what the app is made for.

Libraries used:
- [JOGL](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www) [2.3.2](http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Release_2.3.2)
